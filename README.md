# portfolio

This is my coding work portfolio. 

It consists of HTML and CSS.  

It has a brief "about me" section, links to finished projects, and my contact info. Because I don't have any finished projects to put in my portfolio, I put a link to my gaming blog that I made using WordPress.  The other links/images are placeholders.  

I plan to update it with finished projects in the future.
